# Project Ideas

**1. Regression: Melting Point Prediction**
Melting point is a fundamental physical property that affects formulation, processing, storage, and safety (e.g., handling temperature windows, crystallinity). Predicting it from structure lets chemists screen candidate compounds before synthesis and prioritize molecules with suitable solid‑state behavior.

**2. Regression: pKa Prediction**
pKa controls ionization state, which in turn influences solubility, permeability, binding interactions, and chromatographic behavior. Accurate pKa prediction helps in drug design, buffer selection, and understanding speciation across pH ranges relevant to biology and manufacturing.

**3. Regression: Chromophore λmax (Absorption Maximum)**
The wavelength of maximum absorption determines color, photostability, and suitability for optical probes, dyes, or light‑activated chemistries. Predicting λmax from structure accelerates discovery of pigments, fluorescent tags, and photoresponsive materials without exhaustive spectroscopy.

**4. Classification: Molecular Taste (e.g., Bitter vs. Non‑Bitter)**
Taste liabilities (bitterness, sweetness, off‑flavors) impact patient adherence for oral drugs and consumer acceptance of food additives. A taste classifier lets teams flag problem scaffolds early and guide prodrug design, masking strategies, or alternative delivery routes.

**5. Classification: Toxicity (Tox21 Dataset)**
Early toxicity assessment reduces late‑stage failures, cost, and animal testing. Training classifiers on assays from Tox21 helps students learn how to translate high‑throughput screening data into structural alerts and prioritize safer chemical space in lead optimization.
